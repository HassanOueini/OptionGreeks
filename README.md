# Abstract 
Options are financial derivatives that allow users to "make a bet" on what price they see the stock at a certain time. For example I buy a call option for Decemeber 31, 2025 for Microsoft with the strike price as $500. This means I make a profit if the stock exceeds that price. If it falls short I will make nothing and the investment goes to zero. When analyzing options there are many factors to consider. This code allows the user to calculate the options sensitivities to certain factors. Those include: changes in the stocks price, change in volatility, changes in the interest rate, and changes in time (how long till the option expires).
